As a Champlain College capstone project, this housing registration web application is a working proof-of-concept for what would allow students to research on-campus living opportunities with details regarding location, room size, roommate possibilities, and more. Likewise, it would allow residential administrators to upload descriptions, images, and floor plans for each hall using an intuitive and centralized control panel.
