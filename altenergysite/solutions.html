<p>The video above demonstrates how an average American family consumes a lot of energy (mostly from fossil fuels) and therefore produces a lot of carbon emissions. But, while it may sometimes seem as if there's little hope for the future of energy, many small changes in personal lifestyle can have a big impact if enough people follow through.</p>
<p>One great start to producing fewer carbon emissions is the evaluation your personal lifestyle. <a href="http://myfootprint.org/" target="_blank">MyFootprint.org</a> provides a simple, easy, and useful quiz that, based on your environmental habits and location, accurately assesses how many earth's our population would need if everyone lived as you do. Once you finsih, the quiz will provide a few ideas for reducing your carbon footprint, some of which are listed below:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Cleaner Transportation</b>: If you find that you spend a lot of time driving alone or flying, try taking more public transportation, carpooling, walking more, and flying less. Methods of transportation such as these produce a lot of greenhouse gases and are big contributors to climate change.</li>
    <li><b>Energy-Saving Devices</b>: Many household items such as toasters, washing machines, lightbulbs, and microwaves use a lot of power. When when buying new appliances such as these, choose those that have been optimized to consume less energy. Additionally, ensuring that your home and water heater are properly insulated will reduce heating energy consumption.</li>
    <li><b>Good Habits</b>: There are several ways you can conserve energy and resources by simply adopting better environmental habits. For example, turn off lights when you're not using a specific room, do not keep the faucet running whil brushing your teeth, take shorter showers, unplug electronics when not in use, do not keep the thermostat too hot or too cold, and choose to purchase green energy (if you can).</li>
    <li><b>Food</b>: Believe it or not, the processing of foods and food packaging accounts for a large part of greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce your food footprint, try to eat meat less often, buy food in less plastic packaging, and buy more food from local stores and farms.</li>
    <li><b>Green Products</b>: Most household products, from cleaning supplies to shampoo and deodorant to building materials, either use some form of unnatural chemicals to operate successfully or have been constructed with highly inefficient energy. Try to invest in green, biodegradable, and non-toxic alternatives when possible.</li>
</ul>
