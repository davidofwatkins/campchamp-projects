<h1>Renewable Energies</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">Renewable energy is a much more sustainable energy than a lot of the major fuel sources we currently use and the switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources is closer than it sounds. We already have a lot of renewable energy harnessing technology in place. Sources such as nuclear power, hydropower, wind and solar power, are all a part of the future of renewable energy.</p>

<h2>Nuclear Power</h2>
<p>Nuclear power uses an already partly radioactive source that is naturally occurring on Earth: Uranium. Current nuclear power uses a technique called fission, which involves splitting the nucleus of an atom to create energy.</p>

<p>Fusion is the opposite of nuclear fission in that instead of splitting atoms you force them together. Fusion is the foreseeable future of nuclear energy. Learn more about it in this TED video:</p>

<h2>Biomass Energy</h2>
<p>One growing form of renewable energy comes from biomass matter (i.e., living and dead organisms). Common items such as wood, food, plants, methane from sewage, garbage, and alcohol create biofuels and other biomass energies when undergoing specific chemical and thermal reactions. And because we rely on and dispose of such materials every day, being able to process them to create energy can be ideal.</p>

<h2>Hydropower</h2>
<p>This form of energy comes from the force of moving water. It is a very natural form of renewable energy, as the movement of water is a continuous cycle called the water cycle. It is called a renewable energy source because Earth continuously replenishes its resources through precipitation. It is not a new form of energy, either, as it has been used for centuries. For example, the Greeks used water wheels for purposes such as grinding wheat into flour.  Centuries later, in the 1800s, water wheels were used in the American and European cultures to power machines.</p>

<h2>Tidal Power</h2>
<p>Using tidal power to generate energy is an easy and efficient technique for creating renewable energy from water and air. In fact, there are many ways that people have implemented tidal energy.  In some cases, dams are used to collect water during high tide. After the tide has lowered significantly, this water is expelled quickly from the dams through turbines which generate electricity. Similarly, some apparatuses allow tide to rise into chambers or tunnels. As the water level rises or lowers, air is pushed in and out of the chamber and spin wind turbines to generate energy. Another method uses multiple containers of pressurized liquid, floating on the water's surface. These containers are connected so that, as the tide changes, the liquid is moved from one to another, spinning turbines to create energy. For the past fourty years, tidal power techniques such as these have been used in France, the only country to currently fully implement tidal power into its energy strategy.</p>

<h2>Wind Power</h2>
<p>Wind power is perhaps one of the most popular forms of renewable energy. Since the wind is a virtually unlimited resource, wind is a completely renewable form of energy. To generate energy from the wind, wind turbines rotate gearboxes on generators.</p>

<h2>Solar Power</h2>
<p>Solar power is the harnessing of solar energy. There are a few different ways solar power can be harnessed. All solar energy from the sun would be enough to power all human consumption for a fourth of a century.</p>

<p><b>Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels</b>: these are the most common when it comes to gathering solar energy. They are ideal for the home and workplace, and are good for places where electricity supplies don't exist yet (remote communities). With increases in technology, these systems may be able to power industrial facilities in the future.</p>

<p><b>Solar Thermal</b>: collecting solar energy for thermal energy (heat). They work with low, medium and high temperatures in different shapes: low are flat plates used to heat swimming pools, medium are also flat plates but heat water or air, high are used for electric power production and concentrate sunlight by using mirrors or lenses.</p>

<p><b>SWH and Heat Pump</b>: water that is heated by the sun.</p>

<h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
<p>Geothermal energy is created by the heat from radioactive decay under high pressure underground that rises up from magma and cracks in the Earth's crust. This heats underground water supplies and creates steam which is used for direct power. Since steam is used for direct power, geothermal power plants take up hot water which is converted into steam for energy.</p>

<h2>Experimental forms of Renewable Energy</h2>
<p>So far, the types of renewable energy that have been most seriously considered are the ones listed above. However, there are many other experimental methods some people are theorizing and implementing to create energy. Some of these are listed below:</p>
<h3>Renewable Dance Floor</h3>
<p style="float: left; width: 400px;">This dance floor takes advantage of body weight and movement to create energy when dancers step down on the tiles of the floor by turning a crank wheel and therefore generating energy. Although this method may not seem to create a large amount of energy, with enough dancers and movement, it could create enough energy to sustain at least part of the power used in dance parties.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<h3>Kite Energy</h3>
<p style="float: right; width: 280px; margin-top: 20px;">Wind power is one of the most popular and successful forms of alternative, renewable energies. To imporve wind power, Saul Griffith suggests using kites to generate more wind energy than ever before. This provides more energy than traditional wind power because there is more wind high in the sky than there is only yards above ground.</p>
