<h1>History of Energy Development</h1>

<img src="images/mascot1.png" style="float: left" />
<p>Mankind has been reliant upon energy for thousands of years. In some form or another, energy has allowed ships to sail, water to be pumped, light to be generated, and mechanisms to conduct other automated tasks. Although it may be surprising, some forms of energy such as coal have been used as early as 2000 BC. But as societies have become more dependent upon energy and fuel, the earth's natural resources are being depleted, and traditional methods for creating energy are proving to be harmful to the environment. Fortunately, recent history has shown that cleaner energies such as solar and wind are becoming more prevalent. If we continue to improve upon clean, renewable energies, perhaps our futures will be brighter than ever.</p>

<p>The first known form of energy was coal, used by the in 2000 BC. Eventually, the Chinese would use this coal to create oil and natural gas for extracting salt from seawater in 200 BC. During the same time, Europeans used waterwheels to power mills and crush grain. This reduced the need for man- and animal-power and increased productivity. C. 900 BC, the Persians used windmills to pump water and grind grains. Although these forms of energy appear relatively primitive from our modern times, they were an important foundation to future of energy production and consumption.</p>

<p>Energy did not continue to evolve until the 1600s, when improvements to coal production in England allowed for the creation of iron and steel. At this point, coal became an even more efficient energy source, and it replaced most other less powerful forms of energy. In 1712, Thomas Newcomen built the first steam engine in England. It was used to pump water out of coal mines. In 1748, coal production made its way to the United States (Richmond, Virginia), and by 1821, William Hart drilled the first natural gas well in Fredonia, New York. And nine years later in 1830, coals surpassed wood as the largest source of fuel for trains.</p>

<p>In 1838, the first hydrogen fuel cell (called the "Grove Cell") was developed by William Robert Grove. It generated 12 amps of electricity at 1.8 volts by submerging platinum and zinc electrodes into nitric acid and zinc sulfate, respectively. The world's first solar system, nicknamed the "sun engine," was developed in France in 1860 to produce steam for powering machinery. The technology used mirrors to reflect the sun's light and was created out of fear that the world's fossil fuels were being depleted too quickly. In 1876, selenium was used to generate electricity directly from the sunlight for the first time. In 1882, the first electric plant was built by Thomas Edison near Wallstreet and provided electricity to an entire square mile. While this did not use clean or renewable energy, it was an important milestone in the history of energy.</p>

<img src="images/mascot4.png" style="float: right" /><p>But, non-fossil fuel energies continued to develop as well. Charles Brush in 1888 built the first windmill that created electricity directly, and in 1921, the world's first geothermal plant was built in California, just north of San Francisco. Fourteen years later, the Hoover Damn was built as the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. In 1951, the first nuclear reactor was developed, though it was only able to create enough energy for four 100-watt light bulbs. Bell Laboratories (known today as AT&amp;T Labs) created the first silicon solar cell in 1953, which the New York Times called "the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of harnessing the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization." And in 1958, Dr. Hans Ziegler insisted that the first US Satellite to be launched into orbit use solar power. The military believed the technology was too young and unreliable and were planning to use traditional chemical batteries. But, Ziegler ultimately persuaded the military into using both solar power and batteries, arguing that the batteries would run out of power within weeks&mdash;and they did&mdash;whereas the solar power would last for years. In 1978, an entire village in the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation in Arizona was powered by solar power. <img src="images/mascot3.png" style="float: left" style="margin: 15px;" />The solar energy pumped water and powered fifteen homes until grid power eventually reached the village in 1983, at which point, the solar energy was only used to pump the community well. In 1980, the world's first wind farm was built in New Hampshire, consisting of twenty turbines producing thirty kilowatts each. Unfortunately, these turbines broke down regularly and ultimately required too much maintenance to keep running. But one year later, this led to construction in California of the world's largest wind farm with 4,800 wind turbines, each producing 576 megawatts and 1.1 terawatt-hours per year.</p>

<p>The history of energy has included fossil fuels, wind, solar, and more. Today, nothing is more important to our society than power, and as traditional fuels start to deplete, our dependence upon them will only grow. As history shows, clean, renewable energies have been also growing&mdash;perhaps now more than ever. If these and other clean technologies receive enough attention and funding, perhaps we will be able to remove our dependency on fossil fuels and produce a cleaner future of energy.</p>
